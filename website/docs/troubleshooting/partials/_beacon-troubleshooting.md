      <td>Beacon node is stuck during initial sync.</td>
      <td>If your node seems stuck (either doing nothing, or stuck in a loop) while syncing, a restart will usually resolve the problem. If you're on Windows, try selecting your console output window and hitting <code>ENTER</code> - this can "unpause" a paused console output stream.</td>
